## 🧱 Architecture

### ✅ 3-Tier Architecture

The backend is structured using a *3-Tier Architecture*, which separates the application into:

1. *Presentation Layer*  
   - Responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses (Controllers - ASP.NET Core API).
2. *Business Logic Layer*  
   - Contains the core logic, services, and interfaces.
3. *Data Access Layer*  
   - Handles communication with the database using Entity Framework Core.

### 🧩 Design Pattern: Repositry Pattern

We applied the *IRepository Design Pattern* to abstract and decouple the data access layer from the business logic.  
This promotes cleaner code, easier testing, and better maintainability.
